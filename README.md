# CAMPSwitch: De Novo Design of a Ligand-Gated Protein Switch
A computational project focused on the rational design, simulation, and analysis of a small *de novo* protein that functions as a conformational switch gated by cyclic AMP (cAMP).

## ðŸ§¬ Abstract

This repository documents the end-to-end computational design of **CAMPSwitch**, a synthetic mini-protein intended to function as a molecular biosensor. The protein is designed to transition between two distinct conformational states ("open" and "closed") upon binding the second messenger molecule, cAMP. The project leverages state-of-the-art tools for protein design (RFDiffusion, ProteinMPNN), structure prediction (AlphaFold2), and biophysical validation through extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enhanced sampling (Metadynamics) to map the free energy landscape of the switching mechanism. The ultimate goal is to establish a robust computational pipeline for creating functional, dynamic proteins for applications in synthetic biology and diagnostics.
