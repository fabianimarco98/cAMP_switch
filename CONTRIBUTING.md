# Contributing to cAMP_switch

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the cAMP binder design project!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter bugs or have suggestions:
1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - System information (OS, software versions)
   - Error messages or logs

### Suggesting Enhancements

For feature requests:
1. Describe the proposed feature
2. Explain the use case and benefits
3. Provide examples if applicable

### Contributing Code

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cAMP_switch.git
   cd cAMP_switch
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make changes**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments where necessary
   - Update documentation

4. **Test your changes**
   - Ensure scripts run without errors
   - Test on sample data if available
   - Verify documentation is accurate

5. **Commit changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description"
   ```

6. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Include type hints where appropriate

Example:
```python
def analyze_structure(pdb_file: str, cutoff: float = 5.0) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze protein structure from PDB file.
    
    Args:
        pdb_file: Path to PDB file
        cutoff: Distance cutoff in Angstroms
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with analysis results
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Shell Scripts
- Use bash shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
- Set error handling: `set -e`
- Add comments for complex commands
- Use meaningful variable names (uppercase for globals)

### Documentation
- Use Markdown for documentation
- Include examples and usage
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use clear, concise language
